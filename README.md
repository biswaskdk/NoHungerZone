# NoHungerZone
At TruHacks 2024, we tackled the critical issue of global food insecurity and waste. Our solution? NoHungerZone, a website that connects people in need with local food resources.

Through collaboration, we built NoHungerZone using HTML, CSS, and PHP. The website allows users to:

    Search for nearby food pantries, soup kitchens, and other food resources.
    Access vital information about each resource, including hours of operation, eligibility requirements, and contact details.

By bridging the gap between those facing food insecurity and available resources, NoHungerZone empowers communities and aims to reduce food waste.

How it works
   - User can sign up as donor or recipients.
   - Donor list surplus food items available for donation.
   - Recipients browse listings and select the posted available food.
   - Seamless matching and coordination facilitated through the platform.
